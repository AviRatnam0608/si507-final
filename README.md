# Environmental Impact of Transportation

## Overview

The "Environmental Impact of Transportation" project is a Python-based web platform designed to assist users in making eco-friendly commuting choices. By integrating transportation data, traffic patterns, and emissions statistics, the system offers personalized recommendations for more sustainable transportation alternatives. Users can input their daily commute details and preferences to receive insights into the environmental impact of their current transportation methods.

## Project Objectives

- **Environmental Awareness:** Increase awareness about the environmental impact of transportation choices.
- **Sustainability:** Encourage users to adopt more eco-friendly commuting options.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provide users with data-driven insights for informed commuting decisions.

## Data Sources

- **Public Transit Data:** Google Maps Directions API, TransitLand API.
- **Traffic and Navigation Data:** TomTom Traffic API, HERE Traffic API.
- **Environmental and Emissions Data:** EPA APIs, World Bank Data API.
- **Geocoding and Mapping APIs:** Google Geocoding API, Leaflet/Mapbox API.
- **Alternative Transportation Data:** Bike Share APIs, Ride-Sharing APIs.
- **Weather Data:** OpenWeatherMap API.

## Data Processing Methods

1. **Data Collection:** Retrieve real-time and historical data from selected APIs.
2. **Geocoding:** Convert user-input locations into geographical coordinates.
3. **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Calculate carbon footprints based on emissions and traffic conditions.
4. **Recommendation Engine:** Identify sustainable alternatives using a recommendation engine.
5. **Visualization:** Present findings through interactive maps and a user-friendly dashboard.

## Data Interaction Methods

1. **User Input:** Input details such as home and workplace locations, departure/return times, vehicle type, and fuel type.
2. **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Calculate carbon footprint based on user transportation choices.
3. **Recommendations:** Provide personalized suggestions for eco-friendly commuting options.
4. **Visualization and Reporting:** Display findings, carbon footprint comparisons, and recommended options through interactive maps and a dashboard.
